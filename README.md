# ERP Implementation Project - Fishing Industry 👑🐟

## Project Description 📜
As the Project Manager for this ERP implementation project, I led the digitalization effort to simplify the catch registration process for local fishermen while ensuring compliance, transparency, and sustainability. The project involved developing consumer-grade mobile apps, integrating them with SAP systems, optimizing procurement processes, and providing training and support to users. I collaborated with their sister companies and SAP representatives, managed the project budget and resources, and employed change management strategies to facilitate successful adoption.

## Roles and Responsibilities 🤝
- Developed a comprehensive project plan, set project objectives, and defined the scope.
- Led a cross-functional project team, fostering a collaborative and motivated work environment.
- Managed stakeholder relationships and facilitated effective communication.
- Monitored project progress, budget, and risk, implementing mitigation strategies.
- Ensured the successful development and integration of mobile apps with SAP systems.
- Conducted change management activities to promote user adoption and manage resistance.
- Oversaw training sessions and provided ongoing support to users.

## Retrospective 🚀
In the project retrospective, we reflected on our successes and challenges. We celebrated the successful implementation of the mobile apps and integration with SAP systems, which significantly streamlined the catch registration process. We acknowledged the initial resistance to change from some fishermen and staff but highlighted the effectiveness of our change management strategies in overcoming this obstacle. We identified areas for improvement in project planning and communication to enhance future projects.

## Issues and How They Were Handled 🚧
1. Technical Challenges: During app development, we encountered technical issues that delayed the project. We promptly engaged with their technical experts and SAP representatives to resolve the problems. Rigorous testing and quality assurance measures were implemented to prevent recurrence.

2. Connectivity in Remote Locations: Some fishing locations had limited connectivity, affecting the app's offline functionality. We optimized offline capabilities and data synchronization to ensure smooth app performance even in low-connectivity areas.

3. Scope Creep: Stakeholders requested additional features, potentially derailing the project. We carefully assessed the impact of these requests on project objectives, timeline, and budget. We implemented a formal change management process to manage scope changes effectively.
